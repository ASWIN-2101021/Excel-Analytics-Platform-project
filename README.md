A project built during my internship with Zidio Development

Database: MongoDB
Frontend: React
API: Express.js
Auth: JWT
UI: Tailwind + ShadCN
State Management : Zustand
Email Sending: Nodemailer with my personal Gmail account using app passwords

The frontend is deployed on Cloudflare Pages, while the backend is hosted on Render.

I usually use Hono for serverless APIs or Next.js for fullstack projects, but the focus of this internship was to learn, build, and ship a full-fledged MERN stack application.
